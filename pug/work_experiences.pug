      | I am part of the Pickup Experience team. On a day to day basis, I either work on app's features, 
      | refactor our codebase, analyse data or monitor running A/B tests. 
      | Building new features implies meeting with product and design, tech specing work, breaking down
      | projects into smaller tasks, asking for peers' review and working with QA.
      | I also work closely with our client release team to monitor our production apps' health.
